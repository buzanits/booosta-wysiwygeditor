Booosta allows to develop PHP web applications quick. It is mainly designed for small web applications.
It does not provide a strict MVC distinction. Although the MVC concepts influence the framework. Templates,
data objects can be seen as the Vs and Ms of MVC.

Up to version 3 Booosta was available at Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/booosta/ From version

This is an early development version which cannot be used yet. Get Booosta 3 from Sourceforge or wait for
a usable version. Sorry, there will be no (easy) upgrade path from Booosta 3 to Booosta 4.
